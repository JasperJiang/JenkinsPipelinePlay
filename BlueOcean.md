# What is Blue Ocean

Blue Ocean rethinks the Jenkins user experience. Designed from the ground up for Jenkins Pipeline and compatible with Freestyle jobs, Blue Ocean reduces clutter and increases clarity for every member of your team through the following key features:

* Sophisticated visualizations of CD pipelines for fast and intuitive comprehension of software pipeline status.
* Pipeline editor that makes automating CD pipelines approachable by guiding the user through an intuitive and visual process to create a pipeline.
* Personalization of the Jenkins UI to suit the role-based needs of each member of the DevOps team.
* Pinpoint precision when intervention is needed and/or issues arise. The Blue Ocean UI shows where in the pipeline attention is needed, facilitating exception handling and increasing productivity.
* Native integration for branch and pull requests enables maximum developer productivity when collaborating on code with others in GitHub and Bitbucket.

Note that the Blue Ocean plugin is the only one that you need to install from the Jenkins Update Center.
